# Sort By Log Size Plugin for Adium

This is a simple plugin for [Adium](http://adium.im/) that allows the contact list to be sorted by chat transcript size. The result is that the people you talk to most float to the top of your contact list.

## Latest release

The [latest release](http://adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=6059) of the plugin is version 1.2.2, which is available from [Adium Xtras](http://adiumxtras.com/).

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the development of this plugin, there are a few things you can do to help:

 * Take a look at the source code and tell me why I'm a bonehead and what I can do better. I'm not new to programming, but this is my first project in Objective C (and certainly my first Adium plugin).
 * Open an issue if you find something amiss or if there's something you'd like to see added to the plugin.
 * Help translate things! There aren't many strings in this plugin, but I don't really speak anything but English. Please see the [string localization wiki page](https://github.com/jchambers/sort-by-log-size-plugin/wiki/String-localization).

Thanks!
